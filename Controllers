    OAuth Authentication:

Users click on a "Sign in with Google" button on your registration page.
They are redirected to Google's login page, where they provide their Google Institute IDs and authenticate themselves.
OAuth Callback Handling:

After successful authentication, Google redirects users back to your application's /oauth/callback URL.
The /oauth/callback method in your controller handles this callback.
It retrieves user information from the OAuth token, including the Google Institute ID.
User Registration or Login:

The /oauth/callback method checks if the user's Google Institute ID already exists in your database.
